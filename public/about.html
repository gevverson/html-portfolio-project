<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I'm a passionate and curious developer who loves turning ideas into real,<br />
  functional, and visually appealing digital experiences. My journey into
  <br />coding started with a drive to understand how the web works, and it<br />
  quickly grew into a deep interest in creating modern, user-friendly
  applications.
</p>

<p>
  I specialize in building projects with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and <br />
  frameworks like Vue and Tailwind CSS. Beyond the code, I enjoy<br />
  problem-solving, breaking down complex challenges, and continuously<br />
  learning new tools and technologies to stay ahead in the fast-changing tech
  world.
</p>

<p>
  Outside of development, I value creativity, growth, and balance. <br />
  Whether I'm refining a project, exploring new skills, or enjoying<br />
  time offline, I always aim to bring energy and dedication to everything I do
</p>
